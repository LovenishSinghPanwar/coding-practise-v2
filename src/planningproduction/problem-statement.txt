Planning Production
    You must plan production for a company that manufactures multiple products. Each product has
    two associated costs -

    1. A worst-case cost that must be available before production starts
    2. An expected cost that is actually spent in production

    Determine the minimum amount of starting cash needed to manufacture all products. Products can
    be produced in any order, and after completing each product, the remaining cash can be used for
    subsequent products.

Example -

    worstCase = [6,5,7]
    expected = [4,2,1]

    output - 9
